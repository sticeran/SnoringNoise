## dataset_old:
is the original open-source defect data sets from the literature [1].

## dataset_new:
is our newly collected defect data sets of 8 Apache projects.

## **dataset_old/removed** or **dataset_new/removed**:
project_0.arff and project_1.arff are refined training data, referring to removing instances that are labeled as non-defective of the most recent 1 or 2 release(s) on the original noisy training set (TrS). For details, see RQ2 in the literature [1].
